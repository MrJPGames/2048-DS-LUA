# 2048-DS-LUA
This is a port of 2048, it can be played using Micro LUA for DS (https://code.google.com/p/microlua/)
Part of the code is based of the code used in the PSP Lua version I made a while back
Hope you'll enjoy playing this version!

"Special Features"
===
Touch controls -_-<br>
"30 FPS cinematic gameplay" <br>
(Probably Micro LUA's fault but unsure, might try to improve but for a game like this not really needed anyway)
